# Sprint 5 Integrated Project
In this project I will be looking at historical data for video game sales through 2016. The data provided includes the name of the game released, what platform it was released on, the year it was released, the genre it falls under, sales in millions for North America, Europe, Japan, and Other (all other regions), critic score out of 100, user score out of 10, and ESRB rating. It is worth noting that data for 2016 may be incomplete, so we might not have a complete picture of the sales for 2016. I will compare sales from platform to platform over time in order to determine a rough lifespan of the average platform. This will help decide which platforms to focus on to forecast sales for 2017. Once this is determined, I will do an analysis of the data to determine what factors contribute to a succesfully selling game. 

## The Data
The data was taken from one dataset on video game sales. 
**games.csv:** 
- Name (name of game)
- Platform (platform it was released on)
- Year_of_Release
- Genre
- NA_sales (North American sales in USD million) 
- EU_sales (sales in Europe in USD million) 
- JP_sales (sales in Japan in USD million) 
- Other_sales (sales in other countries in USD million) 
- Critic_Score (maximum of 100) 
- User_Score (maximum of 10) 
- Rating (ESRB)

## The Process
First I cleaned and explored the data, ensuring that there were no duplicates or missing values. I converted the data to the proper datatypes, and renamed the columns to make sure they were consistent among all columns. I then went on to using the groupby method to gather various different metrics and observe different trends among video game sales. I used data visualization, creating various different graphs to make these trends easier to observe. I then focused on the sales of each region: North America, Europe, and Japan, and observed the trends among region. Once again using data visualization in the process. Lastly, I forumlated and tested hypotheses.
